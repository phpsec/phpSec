Installing
---------------
phpSec is now a PSR-0 compatible library. this means that it can easilly be installed and loaded using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).
You can also install phpSec manually, or using Git.

### Installing using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
To install using Composer just add phpSec to your composer.json file in your project directory.
```
{
    "require": {
        "phpsec/phpsec":"0.6.*"
    }
}
```

Then all you need to do is to run `$ php composer.phar install` .
phpSec can then be loaded using the Composer autoloader.

`require 'vendor/autoload.php';`

### Installing manually/Git
Download, checkout or peferrably add phpSec as a Git submodule.
To add an autoloader to your project there is [one example here](http://gist.github.com/221634).
This can be initialized like this:

```php
<?php
require_once 'SplClassLoader.php';
$classLoader = new SplClassLoader('phpSec', '/var/www/vendor/phpSec/lib');
$classLoader->register();
```

If you already have a PSR-0 compatible autoloader for your project there is no need to add another.
All you have to do is to register the *phpSec* namespace to the *phpSec/lib* folder.

For documentation on how to use the various phpSec functionality, take alook at the [phpsec/doc](https://github.com/phpsec/doc) repository. 

System requirements
-------------------
* PHP >= 5.3.7
* [Mcrypt](http://no.php.net/manual/en/mcrypt.installation.php), if you want to encrypt stuff.
